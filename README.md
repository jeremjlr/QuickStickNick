# QuickStickNick
QuickStickNick was a program used to automatically perform the best BM Hunter DPS rotation in WoW during the Battle for Azeroth expansion.

## About The Project
The program uses the WeakAura addon to keep track of ingame information then detects the presence of the auras using screen monitoring and image processing.
It then goes through a priority list based off simulationcraft for optimal DPS. 
Thus allowing the player to do to optimized DPS automatically only using 3 keys (single target, multi target, single target+cleave) for different combat situations.

## Roadmap
None, this project was tested and used in game successfully with BM Hunter for months but it is now discontinued as I am not playing the game anymore.
I am however leaving it here to be used as an example.
